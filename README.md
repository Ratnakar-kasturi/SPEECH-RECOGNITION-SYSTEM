# **DESCRIPTION**:
The **Speech Recognition System** is a Python script designed to convert spoken audio into text. It provides a basic, functional speech-to-text capability, primarily utilizing Google's Web Speech API for transcription. This system is ideal for transcribing short audio clips captured directly from a microphone.

**Key Features and Functionality:**

* **Microphone Input:** Captures audio directly from the user's default microphone.
* **Ambient Noise Adjustment:** Includes a feature to adjust for background noise, enhancing the accuracy of transcription.
* **Google Web Speech API Integration:** Leverages the robust capabilities of Google's cloud-based speech recognition service for converting audio to text.
* **Error Handling:** Incorporates error handling for common issues such as unintelligible speech (`UnknownValueError`) and problems connecting to the API service (`RequestError`).
* **Simple Interface:** Provides a straightforward command-line interface for immediate use and demonstration.

**Purpose:**

This system serves as a foundational example for building speech-to-text applications. It can be used for:

* Quick dictation of short notes.
* Basic voice command recognition.
* Demonstrating the integration of speech recognition libraries in Python projects.

**Dependencies:**

* `SpeechRecognition` library
* `PyAudio` (for microphone access)

This system offers a clear starting point for anyone looking to integrate speech-to-text functionality into their Python projects.
